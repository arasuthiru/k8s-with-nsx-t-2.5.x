_**This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in this series of posts belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the authorâ€™s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.**_

The goal of this series of posts is to outline and explain the steps to integrate <b>VMware NSX-T 2.5.0</b>, using its declarative API called **Policy API** , with Kubernetes control plane.

List of components used in this environment are;

- vCenter 6.7 U1b (Build 11727113)
- ESX 6.7 U2 (Build 13006603)
- NSX-T 2.5.0 (Build 14663978)
- NSX Container Plugin 2.5.0 (Build 14628220)
- Ubuntu Server 18.04.3
- Docker CE 18.06.0
- Kubernetes 1.14.7

It is highly recommended to check the following resources for compatibility requirements.

* VMware Product Interoperability Matrices

* NSX Container Plugin 2.5 Release Notes

This series does **NOT** provide the generic intro level information on NSX-T or K8S. To have a basic understanding of NSX-T please watch the VMworld session recordings. Similarly for K8S, Pluralsight and A Cloud Guru trainings by Nigel Poulton and Udemy trainings by Mumshad Mannambeth is highly recommended.  

<b>The [Part 1](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%201/README.md) , [Part 2](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%202/README.md) and [Part 3](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%203/README.md) of the NSX-T 2.4.x series</b> can be reviewed to get a basic understanding of how the integration of NSX-T with K8S looks like. <b>[Part 5](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%205/README.md) and [Part 6](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%206/README.md)</b> of same series may still help in understanding and learning K8S Service an K8S Network Policy constructs though.

This series will be focusing on the delta between NSX-T 2.4.x and NSX-T 2.5.x hence it may refer to some of the points that were mentioned in previous series [K8S with NSX-T 2.4.x](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x)
