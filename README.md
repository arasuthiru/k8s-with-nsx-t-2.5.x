_**This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in this series of posts belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the authorâ€™s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.**_

The goal of this series of posts is to outline and explain the steps to integrate VMware NSX-T 2.5.0, using its declrarative called **Policy API** , with Kubernetes control plane.

Software components used are listed below.

- vCenter 6.7 U1b (Build 11727113)
- ESX 6.7 U2 (Build 13006603)
- NSX-T 2.5.0 (Build 14663978)
- NSX Container Plugin 2.5.0 (Build 14628220)
- Ubuntu Server 18.04.3
- Docker CE 18.06.0
- Kubernetes 1.14.7

It is highly recommended to check the following resources for compatibility requirements.

* VMware Product Interoperability Matrices

* NSX Container Plugin 2.5 Release Notes

This series does **NOT** provide the generic intro level information on NSX-T or K8S. To have a basic understanding of NSX-T please watch the VMworld session recordings. Similarly for K8S, Pluralsight and A Cloud Guru trainings by Nigel Poulton and Udemy trainings by Mumshad Mannambeth is highly recommended.  

<b>The [Part 1](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%201/README.md) , [Part 2](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%202/README.md) and [Part 3](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%203/README.md) of the NSX-T 2.4.x series</b> can be reviewed to get a basic understanding of how the integration of NSX-T with K8S looks like. [Part 5](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%205/README.md) and [Part 6]((https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/k8s-with-nsx-t-2.4.x/blob/master/Part%206/README.md) of the previous series may still help with generic K8S Service an K8S Network Policy logic though.

This series will be focusing on the delta between NSX-T 2.4.x and NSX-T 2.5.x and it may be referring some of the implementation details to the things mentioned in the previous series.
